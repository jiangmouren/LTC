Graph Theory is one the few important fundamentals.
It is the foundation for many algorithms.
1. Graph types:
   Directed&Undirected
2. Graph representation:
   Adjacency List and Adjacency Matrix.
   This often lead to the thought that why in the case of LinkedList and Tree, we only used one vertex to represent
   the whole graph? That's is because in those cases, the graph is connected and all the connected nodes and edges
   are of interest. Refer to "GameOfLife" for more detail.
3. Graph traversal:
   Directed&Undirected + DFS&BFS.
4. Connectivity & Cycle Detection:
   Can use either DFS or BFS. Check if current vertex visited(undirected)/on the current path(directed), to check cycle.
   By the end of the traversal, need to check all nodes are visited, to check the connectivity.
5. Shortest Path:
   BFS&2-directional BFS.

Refer to "DirectedGraph" and "UndirectedGraph" for details.
