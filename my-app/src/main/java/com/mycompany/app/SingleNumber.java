/*Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?
*/

/*
 * To get linear runtime, use hashmap.
 * If want to avoid extra memory, you have to think about bit manipulation approach: use xor to cancel pairs.
