/**
 * Question:
 * Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
 * Note:
 * Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?
 */

/**
 * Ans:
 * First of all, this can be solved as a counting problem. But you will need extra HashMap.
 * Second, the trick here is to realize the binary representation of those integers.
 * Then use the property of Xor to extract singularity out of parity.
