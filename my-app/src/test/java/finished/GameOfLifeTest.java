         * The actual position(left, right, up, down, etc.) doesn't matter.
         * All we care about here is if there is a connection or not, we don't really care about whether the connection
         * is from neighbors[0] or neighbors[1]. If we need to know the relative position, then we need that.
         * But in this case, as far as we are concerned, that's not needed.
         *
         * The correct result for the test result should be 5, but we only get 4.
         * The reason is that all the neighbors' are not properly set up.
         * Basically they do not know they are connected to live ones,
         * neither do these neighbors know the connections among them.
         * It's too complicated to complete the whole connections, will just leave it as now.
